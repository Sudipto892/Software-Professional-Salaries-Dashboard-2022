Excited to share my first Power BI project with all of you! üìäüöÄ
I've been diving into the world of data visualization, and I'm thrilled to showcase my latest Project üåü

‚û° **Project Title** - Software Professional Salaries Dashboard using Power Bl

In this project, I used Software Professional Salaries Dataset 2022 which is available on 'kaggle.com'.

‚û° **Objective**- The objective was to showcase the ability to clean and structure data, create dynamic visualizations, and provide users with interactive tools to explore and analyze the data effectively.

üí° **Some key highlights from my Power BI project**:

- Cleaned and structured data from various sources to ensure accuracy
- Designed intuitive and user-friendly dashboards for easy navigation
- Created dynamic visualizations to analyze trends, patterns, and outliers
- Integrated interactive filters and slicers to allow for personalized exploration
- Added drill-through functionality for detailed analysis at granular levels

‚û° **The project followed the following procedure**:

1. Data Extraction: Data has extracted from "https://www.kaggle.com‚Äù
2. Data Analysis: The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel (Tools- Pivot Table, Filter, Slicer etc. )
3.Data Cleaning & Transformation: The data was loaded into Microsoft Power BI Server. Data cleaned by removing null and duplicate values, correcting spelling errors, and adjusting data types.
4. Data Loading: The transformed data was loaded into ‚ÄòPower Query Editor‚Äô for further analysis.
5. Data Modelling: A logical structure was created for the data through the data modelling process, enabling effective analysis and visualization.
6. Report Building: Intuitive and user-friendly reports and visualizations were created to build the dashboard.
7. Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc)

‚û° **Excited to share some key insights from my recent analysis on job roles, job titles, company locations, average ratings, and salaries:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ It was found that the most offered job roles in the industry are Software Development Engineers (SDEs), indicating the high demand for technical expertise in this field.
